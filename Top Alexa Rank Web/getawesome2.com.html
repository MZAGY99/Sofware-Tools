            <p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Service or Site, we, as well as similar third-party vendors

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimation of

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This <strong>statistical data</strong> provides us with information about the use of the Service, such as
                how many visitors visit a specific web-page on which the Service is used, how long they stay on that
                page, the type of content on that page.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but to the extent Usage Information may be associated
                with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example, because you have registered for the
                Service) and thereby provided us with personal information (such as name, e-mail address, telephone
                number or home address) we treat such information as &ldquo;<strong>Personal Information&rdquo;</strong>
                and will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may also automatically collect the internet protocol (&ldquo;<strong>IP</strong>&ldquo;) address or
                other identifier (&ldquo;<strong>Device Identifier</strong>&ldquo;) for each computer, mobile device,

            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>We also use cookies in order to keep you logged in to the Service if you register with us. Cookies allow

                and pages visited. Cookies may include a Device Identifier along with information about the particular
                type of content in which you have shown interest. Cookies also allow us to select which content is most
                likely to appeal to you and display that content while you are using the Service.</p>

            <p>A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a
                web page or in an e-mail, which indicates that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel

                    better your user experience and provide you with ability to enjoy the extension you installed to the
                    fullest.</p>
                <p>For example, when you install our extension, one of our related websites which offers content
                    and/or other services <u>in the same topic as did the extension</u> (such as – security, music,
                    movies, etc.),
                    can receive information about your recent activity (i.e. – installation of the related extension),
                    and
                    upon visiting the website you may be presented with a dashboard which may include information
                    related to your use of the extension and/or offer you new ways to enjoy the extension.</p>

            <p><strong>Right to Erasure</strong> - In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your

            <p>In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
                circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose
                erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require
                personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to
                processing, pending the verification of that objection.</p>
            <p>Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your Personal Information.
                However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or

            <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes

                <p>getawesome2.com's browser extensions (hereinafter "<b>Service</b>" or “<b>Extensions</b>”
                    or “<b>getawesome2.com</b>”) provides a platform which allows you to customize your new tab and search provider.
                    These and "getawesome2.com" EULA/Terms of Service ("<b>Terms</b>") are the accesses and terms of your use of these extensions.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>
                <p>It is important to emphasize that getawesome2.com does not share its user’s personal
                    information.</p>
                <p>Despite the fact that other search engines may receive information when users provide, we chose not
                    to collect and/or use this information. For instance, if you search a product, other search engines
                    may collect your email address, country of origin, and, if you choose, your nickname, telephone
                    number, website, search history and title, but different from other search sites, we respect all our
                    user’s privacy.</p>

                <p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Service or Extensions, we, as well as similar third-party vendors and/or service providers alike,
                    we may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the
                    Service is accessed and used (“Usage Information”).</p>

                <p>
                    Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimation of
                    your geographic location associated with your IP address, the page served, the time, referring URLs
                    and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.
                </p>

                <p>Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but to the extent Usage Information may be associated
                    with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example, because you have registered for the Service)
                    and thereby provided us with personal information (such as name, e-mail address, telephone number or home address)
                    we treat such information as “Personal Information” and will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
                <p>At getawesome2.com, we don’t advocate in using cookies. In case our user changes settings, then our cookies
                    are
                    used to store those changes. But still, we do not store them or know how to trace you by them. As
                    mentioned, we may use cookies in order to know how did you find us but with no relation to your
                    search actions.</p>
                <p>We also sampling part of the searches, but again, not in a personally identifiable way, as we do not
                    store IP addresses or unique User ID.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <p><b>Uninstall</b></p>

                <p><b>Security</b></p>
                <p>When we collect personal information directly from you, we follow generally accepted industry
                    standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
                    receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
